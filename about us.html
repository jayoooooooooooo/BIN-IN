    <div class="subhead"
        <p>BIN:IN is a Philippine-based environmental system built to inspire a cleaner, greener future for all. More than a platform, BIN:IN is a movement that empowers communities to take active roles in proper waste disposal and environmental responsibility.

Through features like waste tracking, GPS-based bin location tagging, real-time bin condition reporting, and a point-based reward system, BIN:IN turns everyday habits into meaningful change. It’s designed to make waste management simple, accessible, and rewarding.

But BIN:IN doesn’t stop there. Users can also shop for eco-friendly merchandise through the platform, with every purchase directly helping fund the installation of trash bins in underserved areas across the country. It’s a system that links personal responsibility with collective progress.

At BIN:IN, we believe sustainability isn’t just a goal—it’s a lifestyle. Together, we can turn small, conscious actions into nationwide impact.</p>
